Hi all,\\

For those who don't know me, I finished my PhD in Larry's group
recently, and during my PhD made several contributions to the Pyomo
and IDAES software packages.
Over the past year or so, I've received a few requests for advice regarding
software development, and in particular for advice about striking the
right balance between software development and research, both in terms
of effort and general approach while writing code. This is hard to give
general advice about, but one thing that I would have found very useful
as an early PhD student is some advice about how to organize all the different
types of code I write. After thinking about this for several years, I
settled on a structure for several repositories that has helped me organize
my code without spending too much time thinking about it.

I've summarized this system in the attached document.
A lot of this might seem obvious to some people, but was very far from
obvious to me several years ago, and has been very useful in helping 
me think less about code organization and more about actual research
and development.\\

Hope this is useful.

-Robby
